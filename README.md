## Anaconda virtual environment
We provide an Anaconda virtual environment with all the packages that should make the installation of the right versions of numpy, scipy and sympy easy.

## Modelfitting
The modelfitting (see https://brian.readthedocs.io/en/1.4.3/modelfitting.html) was done using Brian 1 (it has not been exported to Brian 2 yet). We provide an anaconda virtual environment to get the right installation. 

## Network simulations
The network simulations can be done by entering either 'python network_threepop_Fleur.py control' or 'python network_threepop_Fleur.py deprived' into the terminal of the virtual environment.  

## Network selection
The selection of the networks was done according to the steps described in the Jupyter notebook
